# Tableau-User-Rating-Analysis-IMDb-

The project aims to identify the audience segments that are more likely to watch/like a movie from past data on IMDb website. This will help in taking a variety of decisions in different organisations. Here are a couple of examples:

- Imagine an advertising agency that wants to promote a client's product on television. Among various parameters to consider for their marketing strategy, one of them is to know whether the content appeals to the targeted customer base of the product. This dashboard can help in answering that very question.

- Imagine a satellite TV broadcasting channel that is spoiled for movie choices to show on their channel and also has to select the time slot to broadcast. My dashboard will help in ascertaining the right movie to show that appeals to a particular audience segment that is historically more active in a certain time slot.

The tableau project consists of 3 dashboards - Movie Overview, Rating Statistics and Gender Behaviour.

**Movie Overview** - Displays Basic information from IMDb of the movie selected like the genre, language, description etc.

**Rating Statistics** - Displays overall user rating statistics like no. of users who voted 1-10, overall votes,average rating distribution by age and region.

**Gender Behaviour** - Displays no. of votes and average rating by gender.
